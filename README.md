> Fluff Bytecode Interpreter written in C for speed (or at least something faster than Java)

Quick thing I whipped up to interpret .fb files faster than in the Java project for Fluff.

This won't get updates unless other people choose to update it or I make a new bytecode revision, because the current instruction set seems fine for the intended use case.
